# Portfolio_Optimization

This dashboard intends to help people with their own Portfolios at the time of selecting its weights based on the Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz 1956). The person can choose the assets he preffers and then based on past performance, an algorithm runs with a Monte Carlo simulation to find the most efficient weights, the ones that maximize the Sharpe Ratio.

**Webscrapping** was used to retrieve the listed stocks both on the S&P and NASDAQ

Finally, a chart is displayed were the performance of the Portfolio is compared to the one of the S&P 500 in the timeframe chosen.

**Deploy** was done using streamlit, here is the link: https://optimal-portfolio.streamlit.app/
